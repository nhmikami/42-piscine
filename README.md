This repository contains my code developed during the Piscine at 42 São Paulo, held in August 2024.

As a newbie to the programming world, I was happy with my progress during the Piscine. I progressed well in the lists of exercises, managed to solve all three rush projects and even got good grades in the exams.

I was also very pleased to be able to help my colleagues, explaining concepts that I had just learned.

I am thrilled to become a cadet at 42 and hope this helps new pisciners out there! ✨
